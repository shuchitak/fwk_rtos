Check RTOS Drivers
##################

*******
Purpose
*******

Description
===========

The RTOS driver tests are designed to regression test RTOS driver behavior for the following drivers:

- gpio
- i2c
- i2s
- intertile
- mic_array
- qspi_flash
- swmem

These tests assume that the associated RTOS and HILs used have been verified by their own localized separate testing.

These tests should be run whenever the local driver code or dependencies in ``fwk_core`` or ``fwk_io`` are changed.

**************
Hardware Setup
**************

The target hardware for these tests is the XCORE-AI-EXPLORER board.

To setup the board for testing, the following connections must be made:

============  ================  ================  =====================================
Pin Desc hil  Pin Desc hil_add     Connection                      Port Name
============  ================  ================  =====================================
GPIO I/O      Unused              X1D02 : X1D39   T1 XS1_PORT_4A Pin 0 : T1 XS1_PORT_1P
I2C SCL       UART TX/RX        SCL IOL : X1D36         T0 XS1_PORT_1N : T1 XS1_PORT_1M
I2C SDA       SPI CS            SDA IOL : X1D38         T0 XS1_PORT_1O : T1 XS1_PORT_1O

Building and Running Tests
**************************

.. note::

    The Python environment is required to run this test.  See the Requirements section of test/README.rst

To build the test application firmware, run the following command from the top of the repository: 

.. code-block:: console

    bash tools/ci/build_rtos_tests.sh

The `build_test.sh` script will copy the test applications to the `dist` folder.

Run the test with the following command from the top of the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    bash test/rtos_drivers/hil/check_drivers_hil.sh


The output file can be verified via python:

.. code-block:: console

    pytest test/rtos_drivers/hil
