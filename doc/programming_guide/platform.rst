Architecture & Hardware Guide
*****************************

At the heart of the platform, the `Architecture & Hardware Guide <https://www.xmos.ai/documentation/XM-014363-PC-LATEST/html/prog-guide/arch-hw-guide/index.html>`_ describes the multicore processors. Multiple xcore processors can themselves be “networked” together with seamless communications.

*****************
Programming Guide
*****************

The `Programming Guide <https://www.xmos.ai/documentation/XM-014363-PC-LATEST/html/prog-guide/index.html>`_ describes how logical cores of an xcore processor can act independently to behave like highly responsive hardware peripherals, or can work as a team to apply all available CPU cycles onto a single compute task.

XTC Tools
*********

The xcore processors are accompanied by the `XTC Tools <https://www.xmos.ai/documentation/XM-014363-PC-LATEST/html/tools-guide/index.html#tools-guide>`__. As well as providing a powerful toolchain for application development, the toolkit assists with application deployment and upgrade.
